### 📝 About the project
- This project was the result of me playing with a multiple pages Flutter app.
- It's an app that gives a couple of recipes filtered by gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan and vegetarian meals.
- The final result was a functional app with multiple pages where the data is passed back and forth through them.
